Semantic Kernel is a lightweight, open-source development kit that lets you easily build AI agents and integrate the latest AI models into your C#, Python, or Java codebase. It serves as an efficient middleware that enables rapid delivery of enterprise-grade solutions.
 Semantic Kernel is a new AI SDK, and a simple and yet powerful programming model that lets you add large language capabilities to your app in just a matter of minutes. It uses natural language prompting to create and execute semantic kernel AI tasks across multiple languages and platforms.
In this guide, you learned how to quickly get started with Semantic Kernel by building a simple AI agent that can interact with an AI service and run your code. To see more examples and learn how to build more complex AI agents, check out our in-depth samples.
